The Sensor Manager app that I made reads the data from the Accelerometer to string values on the main page.
This didn’t take me that long this time as I had a few other apps where I was able to compare the experiences
I had when setting them up before. Though this was the first time that I used the extended controls when testing.
I’m not sure why it never occurred to me that there would be something like this for testing the different sensors
in devices. It does make sense though because if you can emulate the whole phone why leave out the sensors.
Then if you emulate the sensors, you will want a more efficient way to test the app’s functionality without
having to manually connect a physical emulator to test conditions for each of the sensors.

When deciding which sensor to test I thought about them and their usages while deciding, I ended up deciding
on the accelerometer because it’s useful when determining things for something like the progressive driving
tracker that can track things like hard braking and other similar values. I’ve always wondered how they did
that, and I guess now I know. Some other usages for it might be in tandem with the GPS sensors or trackers to
calculate things for Google Maps. The map might use it to more accurately track things to determine where you
are and your speed. This might be used relative to the comparison of your initial speed and the rate you
reach a different GPS position. All this combined could help narrow down and make the maps app more accurate.

In conclusion, many apps could use the accelerometer sensor to help with specific functions that
could either help make the initial purpose of their app more accurate or to rely solely on the
accelerometer. Either of these cases would benefit from the Sensor Manager to help improve their
applications.
