The application I have chosen is the Inventory app. The overarching purpose of the app is to have an easy-to-use method of storing and sorting an inventory. The major components needed are:
- Two databases
- A login screen
- A create user screen
- A main inventory screen
- Relevant buttons for each screen

Each screen should have the necessary grids and checks to ensure that the information being entered is valid.

Similar Apps
Two similar apps to the inventory app are:
1. Amazon App Checkout: Similar in that the different options in the Amazon online store are stored in a database. When you press the add to cart button, it is akin to adding something to the inventory.
2. Task List App: Used to track different reminders you add to it. This app is similar because you add something to a local database and can add/remove items. When the set time comes, it's like the inventory app notifying you when an item reaches zero.

Potential Users
1. Restaurant Manager: Needs to know when some product is close to running out to order more. An app that tracks this would be extremely useful.
2. Auto Parts Store: Wants to be able to tell a customer if something is in stock without searching the entire inventory. The app provides a record of what’s in stock.
3. Online Store Owner: Desires an easy way to update what's in stock for their storefront without manually adding items. The app updates each item’s status, saving the owner a lot of time.

Login/Create Screen
- Create Account Screen:
  - Includes different text boxes for inputs such as name, email, phone number, address, date of birth, password, and username.
  - A create account button checks that all inputs match the criteria.
  - Guidelines for secure password creation should be provided.

- Login Screen:
  - Includes fields for username and password.
  - Buttons for login, forgot username, forgot password, help, and create account.
  - Uses Amazon account data for easier account creation if the user already has an Amazon account.

Main Screen
- Data Source: Draws data from the current logged-in account and profile.
- Sections:
  1. What's Popular Now: Data comes from overall user activity, showing what's being watched and how many people have watched it recently.
  2. Continue Watching: Data from the specific profile’s last watched items.
  3. Featured Now: Recent or new items on the streaming service.
  4. Recommended: Based on user’s watched content or similar user activity, recommending items with similar tags.
  5. Different Genres: Uses relevant tags for genres (e.g., comedy, horror, family). Genres are ordered by the user’s most frequently watched tags.
